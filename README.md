This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Pokedex project is one of the first project exercises in Colt Steele's Modern React Bootcamp course on Udemy.
The project's purpose is to create a simple React App using class based components that passes along props from
Parent to Child components.

The master branch will showcase my completed Class based version of the project.

There will also be another branch where the project is re-factored using Hooks and will also reflect updates to React standard and usage as of January 2021.
